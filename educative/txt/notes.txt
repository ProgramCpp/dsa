STL
Input iterators: Only support == and !=.
Forward iterators: Support ==, !=, and <.
Bidirectional iterators: Support ==, !=, <, >, <=, and >=.
Random access iterators: Support all comparison operators.

Bidirectional iterators: Support ++, --
Random access iterators: ++, --, +n, -n

x = int(c)
x = c - '0' => c > 0 && c < 9

std::map<T>::iterator is of the iterator-class bidirectional iterator. Those only have ++ and -- operators. +N and [] is only available for random access iterators (which can be found in e.g. std::vector<T>).

DS:
stack, queue, deque, map, vector, list, set, multiset, priority_queue(min/ max heap), trees, graphs

algorithms:
sorting, backtracking, dp, two pointers, fast n slow pointer, sliding window, BFS, DFS, greedy

graph: 
BFS, DFS, prims
Union find/ disjoint set, djikstra, min spanning tree, topological sort.
djisktra : from a single source, find shortest paths to all nodes
bellman-ford : same as djisktra, but works for negative number and cheapest-flights-within-k-stops
min spanning tree : connect all the Nodes with minimum costs (n nodes, will have n-1 edges)
top sort : print the one with no incoming edges 
union finds: 
- The amortized time complexity becomes O(α(n)) which is a small constant. Here, α is the inverse Ackerman function- A function whose value grows extremely slowly and does not exceed 4 for any value of n.
- the data is best organized in the form of a graph but it is not provided in adj list/ mat format
- A graph has already been provided in the form of an adjacency list/matrix, and no new edges need to be added, so it would be more efficient to use either breadth-first or depth-first search
- optimizations
    - union by rank: reduces tree height. if one part is already longer, attaching it to the other increases its height by 1. increasing the height with shorter rank relatively results in smaller height
    - path compression: reduces tree height

permutations:
backtracking + include and exclude

lookup string in a groups of words
trie/ hashing with hashmap/ hashing with BST:trie stores 26 alphabets for the max length of words O(L * 26) - not a funtion of n. lookup in O(L)
match string with a group of words partly:
trie
print words alphabetically:
trie
The main disadvantage of tries is that they need a lot of memory for storing the strings. For each node we have too many node pointers - but optimize on stroing prefixes only once

tree:
given h- height, num of nodes(perfectly balanced binary tree) = 2^h-1(only root level has 1 node)
given n nodes at a level, nodes at n+1 level = 2*n

segment trees: 
build by fixing middle elemnt in root. divide input size by 2. build left and right tree.
left child =  2 * root + 1 // 2 times because, if there are root nodes, all its children (2 - complete binary tree) comes before its own children
right child = 2 * root + 2

top k elements: min/ max heap
forward order: queue
reverse order: stack
random lookup: hashtable, array
linear access: vector, array, list
sorted access: tree
