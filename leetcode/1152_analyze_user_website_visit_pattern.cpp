//1152. Analyze User Website Visit Pattern
/*
the fact that combination of only 3 items is asked, you can do brute force for the same
nCr = n! / r! (n-r)!
group movies watched by users
use 3 loops to find combinations of all movies watched by the user. repeat for all users
keep count of pattern and its frequency. keep track of max frequency
iterate and find the pattern with highest frequency


to track patterns, concatenate movie names to handle them easily. separate/ split them in the end.
